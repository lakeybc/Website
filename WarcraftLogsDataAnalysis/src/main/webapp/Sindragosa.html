Sindragosa immediately aggros when both Rimefang and Spinestalker are dead. While learning the encounter, it's a
good idea to initially reset her, which can (sometimes) accomplished by running back to the teleporter pad or 
the last room right after the second frost wyrm dies.

This encounter requires one tank, a second one is a good idea (for Phase 3). Tanks should have a decent amount 
of frost resistance, the paladin aura or shaman totem should also be used. Low stamina raid members can also 
consider wearing a few pieces of FR gear.

Like most dragons Sindragosa deals a rear tail swipe and a frontal cleave, thus only the tank stands in front of her. 
The raid should stand at her side, between tail swipe and cleave. Melee should set up at the outer edge of her (rather large) 
hitbox, ranged a little further out, but not at maximum range. Players who stand too close may miss an Icy Grip (because 
they don't fly through the air), those too far out loose too much time airborne and thus may not be fast enough in running 
away. In preparation of Phase 3, it's a good idea if the raid generally keeps close together, either near her front or hind legs.

								
Phase One

During the whole fight she deals stacking debuffs to the whole raid. When melee attacks her, there's a 20% chance per hit on 
the boss to gain the Permeating Chill stacking debuff which inflicts 1,000 Frost damage every 2 seconds for 8 seconds, per 
stack. For casters, she periodically debuffs mana users with Unchained Magic, which for 15 seconds causes its victims to 
gain a stack of Instability every time they cast a spell (including things like Healthstones or Trinkets). Instability 
expires after 5 sec (unless refreshed by casting another spell). Expiration is unavoidable after Unchained Magic fades. 
Upon expiration, Instability deals 2k damage per stack.

During Phase 1 these debuff stacks don't hurt a lot (it's safe to take up to 8 stacks), but in Phase 2 they 
become dangerous (players should try to stay below 4 stacks). For this reason it's a good idea to practise 
keeping them low even in Phase 1. Managing these debuffs (and the additional one in Phase 2) is the heart 
of the fight. Players may get used to stopping their attacks/casts when their stacks get high.

In regular intervals, she pulls the whole raid on top of herself (Icy Grip) and then starts a 5 sec cast of 
Blistering Cold, which deals 35k Frost damage to everyone within 25 yards of her (with enough HP or resistance 
this is survivable). This means that the raid has 5 seconds to get 25 yards away from her. Players should 
mouse-turn while flying through the air and immediately run away on touchdown. Hunters can use [Aspect of the Pack], 
the frost aura does not cause the daze effect. After everyone is out of range, it must be switched off 
immediately. It is possible to slow her cast time with [Curse of Tongues] or maybe [Numbing Poison]), but 
this may decrease Melee's DPS output because they have to wait longer before running back.

Phase Two (Air Phase)

Every 1:50 minutes, Sindragosa takes off, freezes 2/5 (10/25 player) raid members with Ice Tomb and drops four 
Frost Bombs (one after the other, on random spots). Players who are in line of sight of one of the bomb explosions 
take ~24k damage, therefore the raid should hide behind the Ice Tombs. After the fourth Bomb she lands and continues 
with another Phase 1.

Sindragosa puts a Frost Beacon on the Ice Tomb targets about 5 seconds before they get entombed. Since 
Ice Tombs not only damage their targets, but also everyone else in a 10 yard radius, it's important for 
the ice tomb targets to move away from all non-targets and from each other. After 20 seconds, she's dropped 
all her bombs, lands and resumes Phase 1. At this point, the entombed players start to take damage from 
asphyxiation. Players are freed from the Ice Tombs by destroying them (~450k HP). They should be damaged 
to about 10% while she drops the bombs, and quickly destroyed after the fourth bomb has exploded.

Phase Three

Phase 3 starts when Sindragosa is at 35% health. She becomes permanently grounded, and continues all of her abilities from phase 1. 
Although she stops casting Frost Bombs, Sindragosa continues to cast Frost Beacons and Ice Tombs, which players must use to control 
her new ability, Mystic Buffet. One stack of this debuff is gained by all players in her line of sight every 4 seconds. Each stack 
increases magical damage taken by 10%/15% (10/25 player).

Her time between Ice Tomb casts in phase 3 seems to be 20 seconds.

Phase 3 is not a DPS race, but focuses on the players' ability to manage Mystic Buffet and the other debuffs. Mystic Buffet 
expires after 8 seconds, she refreshes it after 6 (that is with 4 seconds left on the debuff). In effect it's enough to hide 
behind the Ice Block for just the crucial few seconds when she refreshes it.

The 10 player Ice Block routine can be used for both raid sizes in this phase - Frost Beaconed players run to the other side, 
raid follows, hides and destroys the Ice Blocks after they have materialized. With two tanks, it's a good idea to switch tanks 
at this moment too.

Heroic Difficulty

The most important change is that Instability (Unchained Magic's backlash) not only hits the affected player, but 
also everyone else within 20 yards.

Phase 2 (air phase) Frost Bomb damage is increased to 200,000 and is no longer survivable, and in 25m 
(10m stays at 2 players) six players are Frost Beaconed instead of five.

Tips and Tricks

+ In normal mode, up to 8 stacks of Mystic Buffet can be tolerated. Therefore, it's safe to ignore every other Ice Block. 
It's still important to nuke the Ice Blocks to free the entombed players. Don't try this on heroic difficulty where even 
a few stacks are already dangerous.
+ Wearing some frost resist gear increases survivability and may be very useful for learning the fight.
+ During Phase 3, Healers can try to find a place behind an Ice Tomb where they have no LOS to the boss, but can see and heal the tank.
+ It is important to note that when she pulls all raid members into her, she begins casting Blistering Cold as soon as the pull begins, 
not when you land at the foot of the boss. For this reason, the closer you are to the boss, the more time you will have to turn around 
in mid air and get out of range before the AoE takes effect. This is VERY important in heroic mode, as any damage taken from Blistering 
Cold is essentially un-survivable.
