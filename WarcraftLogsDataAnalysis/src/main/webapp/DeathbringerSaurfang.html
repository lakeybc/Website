The fight has only one phase, and while Saurfang does hard enrage after 8 minutes most groups will not last nearly that long. 
At 30% there's a soft enrage (Frenzy), DPS cooldowns are normally saved for that point (although some raids have success using 
them early, and thus delaying the first Mark as long as possible).

Blood Power

Saurfang starts with 0 Blood Power. He can accumulate up to 100 in his Energy bar (akin to death knights). He gains Blood Power whenever 
one of his special attacks hits or ticks. When Blood Power reaches 100, he casts Mark of the Fallen Champion on a random raid member, 
resetting his Blood Power to 0.

Each active Mark increases the rate at which he gains Blood Power. For this reason, it's imperative to limit the amount of Blood Power he 
gains. Saurfang should be at 60% or lower before he casts the first Mark.

Tanking

Saurfang should be tanked right where he spawns, his melee damage is not high. Tanks must pay attention though that 
Saurfang doesn't gain Blood Power from Rune of Blood. If a tank gets it, another tank must quickly taunt and take over. 
The debuff lasts 20 seconds.

Positioning

The melee should stand right on Saurfang. Ranged damage dealers can stand closer to the boss, while healers should be furthest 
away. Healers need to be well spread out, so that all raid members are in range of several healers.

All non-melee raid members must stay at least 12 yards away from each other to avoid activating Blood Nova, else Saurfang receives extra Blood Power.

Blood Beasts

Saurfang summons Blood Beasts every 35 seconds. In: 


+ 10-player - two are summoned: one left, one right.

+ 25-player - five are summoned: one in front of him, two at his sides, and two behind (pentagon shape).

Saurfang gains Blood Power whenever a Blood Beast deals melee damage, thus they must be slowed and kited, and 
killed by ranged DPS. Since Blood Beasts are resistant to AoE it's pointless to use such abilities. Melee in 
particular should avoid using any multi-target abilities (such as  [Heart Strike],[Seal of Command], [Revenge],  
[Hammer of the Righteous], or [Divine Storm]) in order to avoid drawing aggro. The Blood Beasts must leave the 
platform ASAP (in hard mode they're also likely to one-shot melee).

Although Blood Beasts are immune to crowd-control, they are susceptible to root, snare, slow and stun. Be 
careful not to root them within melee range of anybody or else they will attack the closest raid member.

Ranged DPS should target the beast furthest away, and as soon as the beast gains aggro, switch away to another one. 
Ping-ponged between different ranged DPS prevents anyone from being hit in melee. Melee players (or the tank) can help 
by taunting Beasts that are far away from them. If a Beast gets close to its target, that target must run away and start 
kiting - do not let them hit anyone.

Class-specific tactics:
The abilities are articularly helpful for slowing down Blood Bests:

+ Death Knight - [Desecration](Unholy) and [Chains of Ice]

+ Druid - [Typhoon](Balance) and [Entangling Roots]

+ Hunter - [Frost Trap] without [Entrapment]

+ Mage - [Slow](Arcane) and [Frost Nova]

+ Paladin - [Hammer of Justice]

+ Shaman - [Thunderstorm](Elemental) and [Earthbind Totem]

+ Warlock - [Shadowfury](Destruction)

Boiling Blood

Saurfang casts Boiling Blood on random raid members. This can easily be healed through. 
Every tick grants Blood Power. [Blessing of Protection] <i>(Paladin)</i> removes it, 
though that should only be needed in Hard Mode on a player afflicted with Mark of the Fallen Champion.

Mark of the Fallen Champion

Whenever Saurfang gains 100 Blood Power, he casts Mark of the Fallen Champion on a random raid member. 
This debuff inflicts heavy damage (about 6,000 per second in 25 player) and yields a lot of Blood Power 
to the boss. When a player with a Mark dies, this heals Saurfang about 5%. The Mark persists through death
—do not combat rez a player that dies from it.

Heroic Mode

The primary differences of Heroic mode are a shorter enrage timer (6 minutes), Blood Beasts catching Scent of 
Blood 5 seconds after spawning, reducing the movement speed of the entire raid by 80% for 10 seconds, and Saurfang
healing for 20% HP upon a mark of the fallen champion death. His blood power gain is also much faster compared to normal. 
Blood Beasts also hit hard enough to one shot any non tank.

On a first kill, prepare for at least two marks on 10-man and six marks on 25-man. Assign one dedicated healer per mark. 
If healers are struggling towards the end of the fight, they can stop healing one of the tanks because of the mechanics of 
Rune of Blood.
