She should be tanked right at her starting position. She requires two tanks, because she links her primary tank to the player 
standing closest to the tank (Blood Mirror), which means the linked target takes the same amount of damage as the tank. Shamans 
should use [Tremor Totem], and it's a good idea to have all healers in a group with a shaman. If no shamans are available, 
Priests should [Fear Ward] healers.

The raid needs to stay distributed throughout the encounter (6 yards away from everyone else). It's a good idea to keep a circle 
of about 10 yards free of players right in the center of the room, and also to have everyone stay away from the walls. Ranged DPS 
make a semicircle at maximum range.

Strategy

The fight has only one phase. Although every two minutes she performs a very short air phase, the mechanics of the fight remain 
basically the same at all times.

Every player constantly takes damage from her aura (initially 4.5k per tick, increasing with each vampire in the room).

At random intervals, a random raid member gets Swarming Shadows, which makes them drop Shadow Fire on the ground until the 
debuff expires. Affected players can avoid taking any damage by running. It's a good idea to keep the walls free of other players, 
so that players with Swarming Shadows can simply run along the walls.

Another ability which she randomly uses is Pact of the Darkfallen. This links 2/3 (10/25 man) players to each other, they take 
increasing amounts of damage until they stand on top of each other. Linked players should meet in the center of the room.

Every two minutes she takes off, fears the whole raid and launches three extra Blood Bolts at every player. When she takes off, 
ranged DPS should run to the walls of the room while melee spread out in the middle. Healers should be in a circle between melee 
and ranged. After the fear is over, players must spread out again very quickly, else the Blood Bolts can be lethal. Healers should 
move only minimally after the fear and instead start a massive spam of AoE heals right away.

Vampire Debuff

The Blood Queen has an extreme amount of hitpoints and a 5:30 minute enrage timer. An average of 9.8k/7.8k (25/10 player) DPS is 
required to beat it (assuming 2 tanks and 5/3 healers). Virtually all raids use the Vampire debuff to boost their DPS (although it's 
theoretically possible to beat her without using it).

15 seconds after the start of the encounter Blood-Queen Lana'thel bites the highest threat player which is not tanking, dealing the 
Vampire debuff. Becoming a Vampire has the following effects:

+ Targets deal 100% more damage while also creating no more threat
+ Targets heal themselves for 10% of the damage they deal
+ >After 75 seconds, targets must bite other non-Vampiric players or become mind controlled after 15 seconds.

The Blood Queen bites only one player throughout the whole fight. After 60 seconds, this person must bite another raid 
member. After 60 more seconds, both need to bite two more players, next four, and so on. It's extremely important that 
damage dealers get bitten first (starting with the highest DPS first), and healers last. DPS cooldowns should only be 
used after all damage dealers are bitten.

Tips

+ Hunters may use [Deterrence] during Lana'thel's air phase to mitigate damage done to the raid.
+ Use Fear Ward on ranged DPS or a priest before she fears the raid to put in some extra damage or to dispel fear.
+ For 10-man at least, it is possible to have a holy pally OT and heal by beaconing himself if your MT is over geared for the fight.

Heroic Mode

In heroic mode, Blood Queen Lana'thel gains a stack of Presence of the Darkfallen for each vampire present. Each stack of this 
buff increases the power of her Shroud of Sorrow for 5%.
