Two tanks are required, one of them drives the Abomination during Phases 1 and 2. In 25 player, a third tank is recommended (Phase 3 only). 
The encounter becomes easier with more DPS so no more than 2/5 (10/25 player) healers is fine. Putricide enrages 10 minutes after the pull.

Mutated Abomination

One player needs to drive a Mutated Abomination. Mutated Abomination is a disease debuff which must not be cleansed, it is gained by 
clicking on the table at which Putricide starts. If the Abominations dies, a new one can be obtained by clicking the table again. During 
the whole encounter, slime pools spawn randomly. During phases 1 and 2, the Abomination eats these to gain ooze power. Ooze power in turn is 
used to snare the adds which spawn.

In phase 3, the tank inside the Abomination must help tank Putricide, so slime pools start to accumulate and eventually kill the raid (soft enrage).

Tactics
Phase 1: 100% to 80%

This phase is all about add control. Alternately, a green and an orange add spawn from the green or orange tank respectively on each side of the 
room. It's essential to kill each add before the next one spawns. Putricide should be nuked only while no add is up. Since Putricide uses no 
dangerous AoE abilities, it's safe for the whole raid to stand close to him.

Initially, Putricide is tanked next to the Orange tank on the left side of the room. Not long after the pull, Putricide performs an "Unstable 
Experiment," which spawns a Volatile Ooze (green add) next to the green tank on the right side of the room. Ranged DPS should switch to it 
immediately and melee DPS should switch as soon as it is clear who it is targetting. The Volatile Ooze targets and roots a random player and 
moves towards its target; the Abomination pilot needs to snare it with Regurgitated Ooze. Upon reaching its target, the ooze explodes for 175,000 
damage which is split between all players standing on top of the target. The explosion also knocks all affected players back a few yards. After the 
explosion, the Ooze acquires a new target and repeats the process. Positioning players in a group next to a wall can keep the explosions 
from knocking the characters too far apart.

After the Ooze is dead, Putricide and the whole raid should move next to the Green tank. The next Unstable Experiment spawns a Gas Cloud (orange add) 
next to the orange tank. The Gas Cloud follows a random player and applies Gaseous Bloat, a dot which requires a lot of healing. Gaseous Bloat starts 
with numerous stacks that decrease over time. Should the Gas Cloud reach its target while stacks still remain, the whole raid takes a large amount of 
damage, usually leading to a wipe. The target must kite the cloud around the room while everyone else kills it. The abomination pilot should also snare 
it. When the Gas Cloud spawns, ranged DPS should immediately begin nuking it down, while melee DPS should wait until the Gas Cloud's target is.

After this, the raid and Putricide move back to the Orange tank. The adds spawn alternately in a predictable manner.

It's highly desirable to have no add up at the start of Phase 2. For this reason it's a good idea to stop DPS at about 82% and finish off 
the existing add before pushing him into Phase 2 (in well behaved raids this should be automatic because nobody should damage the professor 
while an add is up anyways).

Phase 2: 80% to 35%

Putricide casts Tear Gas, which stuns the raid for 10 seconds during the phase change. Rogues can [Vanish] and Mages can use 
[Invisibility] before Putricide finishes casting. This allows them some extra DPS time. The fight remains basically the same, but 
Putricide gain two additional abilities: Choking Gas Bomb and Malleable Goo.

The Choking Gas Bombs are two flasks which he drops on the ground close to himself. They form an orange cloud on the floor and 
explode after 20 seconds, killing players within in a 10 yard radius. When he drops them, everybody must move away from the flasks.

Malleable Goo looks like a bouncing green slime ball. Putricide randomly targets and tosses 1/2 (10/25 player) goo balls to ranged 
targets. On impact each causes 20,000 AoE damage and slows attack/cast speeds by 200%. All players must move away from the impact 
points of the green bouncing balls.

Just like at the end of Phase 1, stopping DPS a few percentages before he goes into phase 3 to ensure that no adds are up is desirable.

Phase 3: 35% to 0%

Professor Putricide casts tear gas again and phases. As before [Vanish] and [Invisibility] 
allow extra DPS time. With good timing and a little luck, a Shaman can drop a Spell fire elemental 
[Fire Elemental Totem] that's not affected by the Tear Gas as well. This can also be used between Phase 1 and 2, but is more useful for Phase 3.

During Phase 3, adds stop spawning, but adds that are up do remain. Use all DPS cooldowns at the start of this phase. Malleable Goo, 
Choking Gas Bomb, and Slime Pools continue. The Abomination buff is removed and the person inside returns to normal form. This means 
that the slime pools accumulate and start growing. Phase 3 is a DPS race, Putricide must be killed in short order (about 80/120 seconds in 10/25 player).

Any remaining add must be killed immediately. Putricide stacks a debuff on his current tank every 10 seconds (Mutated Plague), which 
has a one-minute expiration timer. The debuff deals AoE damage to the whole raid. If it expires, is removed or somebody dies from it, 
Putricide gains a massive amount of health (300.000 health for each stack that the person had in 10 man). With two tanks, Tank #1 should 
tank it up to 2 stacks, then Tank #2 should tank it up to 2 stacks. After that, the tanks should taunt off each other per stack. With 
three tanks, each tank should initially get 2 stacks, and then to four stacks.

Putricide also stacks a buff on himself called Mutated Strength, causing him to do more damage over time.

In 25-player: In Phase 3, Mutated Plague triples in damage every stack, therefore three tanks are recommended.

Short Version

This is a condensed, easy to read version of the above. It describes the basics of the fight generally for normal modes in limited depth.


Phase 1: Ooze pools should be eaten by the Abomination pilot to gain resources and remove hazards. Alternating, an add spawns 
from the green and orange tanks. The abomination pilot must snare adds using 'Regurgitate ooze'. DPS must priority kill the adds. 
Ranged must stack on the target of the green add, while the orange add must be kited by its target. Only when no adds are up should 
you DPS Putricide. Stop near 80% HP to kill oozes, then proceed into Phase 2 with no adds up.

Phase 2: Continue Phase 1's add management. Choking Gas Bombs and Malleable Goo are dropped by/thrown at the raid. They should be 
dodged. Burn adds that remain before 35% and Phase 3.

Phase 3: Abomination disappears. Avoid slime pools. Adds cease, but Choking Gas and Malleable Goo remain. Burn remaining adds. 
Activate Heroism and other cooldowns now to avoid a soft enrage and keep this delicate phase short. Tanks need to rotate Mutated 
Plague to keep it as low as possible, avoiding raid damage - Tank A receives 2, B receives 2, then taunt off every stack (
A2/B2/A3/B3/A4/B4 etc). DPS stay on Putricide while avoiding raid hazards (slime/goo/bombs). If not killed quickly, 
Putricide soft-enrages around 4 stacks of Mutated Plague (approx. 1m20s/80s) and also soft enrages off Mutated Strength 
if left long enough.

Heroic Difficulty

Professor Putricide gains Unbound Plague, which lasts 60 seconds. Unbound Plague deals 
increasing damage every second, killing players within approximately 15 seconds of being infected. 
It jumps to anyone within 3 yards, leaving a debuff called Plague Sickness every time, which increases 
damage taken from Unbound Plague by 300%, stacking infinitely.

To deal with Unbound Plague the victim should step away from other players for a few ticks, then run in to
pass the disease to another player. This recipient should stand clear for a few ticks, then pass it to 
another player who does not have Plague Sickness. The Plague Sickness debuff means that if you pass the 
nbound Plague back and forth between a few people who all develop Plague Sickness, you can easily overwhelm 
the healers. It is important to pass the Unbound plague to a new player, or one who has at least lost the Plague Sickness.

Rather than casting Tear Gas on the raid on Heroic Difficulty to change phases, Professor Putricide instead debuffs 
half the raid with the Ooze Variable and half the raid with the Gas Variable in 25-player mode. He then spawns both a 
Volatile Ooze AND a Gas Cloud at the same time. Players may only attack targets matching their variable. The 
abomination almost never has enough juice to slow both the ooze and the cloud, so at least one will be moving 
at full speed. It is also possible that he will summon the two adds while the raid is fighting an existing add, 
bringing the total to three.

Overall Professor Putricide's Heroic Mode emphasizes an unforgiving raid environment as both Malleable Goo and Choking
Gas cloud MUST be avoided to avoid the dps loss and to avoid putting strain on the healers. This is even moreso in 
 Phase 3 when getting hit by either could spell a wipe, with dps being lost and healers being overtaxed.

In 10-player mode, there are no Variable debuffs, but he still spawns both a Volatile Ooze and a Gas Cloud at the same time 
instead of casting Tear Gas.
